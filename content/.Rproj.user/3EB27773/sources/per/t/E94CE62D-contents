  Depression has increasingly become recognized as a pressing issue in
  today's society. Currently, the WHO estimates that 4% of the
  population suffers from depression, and 700,000 people die each year
  from suicide. In fact, suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in
  people aged 15-29. Despite the availability of effective treatments
  for depression, many individuals suffering from depression often go
  undiagnosed and untreated due to economic inequality and social
  stigma. Social media presents a promising solution to this issue.
  Today, social media use is extremely widespread, and users' data
  presents a cheap and accessible source of information that can be used
  to identify signs of depression. Thus, this study aims to predict and
  identify signs of depression based on a Twitter user's activity. The
  data consists of a user's tweet history, follower count, friend count,
  and other information. To analyze the data, logistic regression,
  LASSO, decision trees, random forest, and neural networks are utilized
  on the numerical data. For the tweet data, BERT classification,
  bag-of-words, and other textual analysis techniques are applied to
  predict depression and identify words and phrases that potentially
  indicate it. Results will be included once they are produced...

    # Introduction

    Depression is a critical and socially relevant issue that affects millions of people worldwide, significantly impacting their quality of life and overall well-being. It is a leading cause of disability and can result in severe outcomes, including suicide. Recent events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have exacerbated the prevalence of depression, with many individuals facing increased stress, isolation, and uncertainty. This rise in depression rates has been further compounded by the challenges associated with accessing mental health care. Rising healthcare costs, coupled with the necessity of in-person consultations, make it difficult for many individuals to seek diagnosis and treatment, often requiring significant time and resources.

    In response to these challenges, social media presents a promising alternative for identifying signs of depression in a more accessible and cost-effective manner. With its pervasive use and the vast amounts of data generated daily, platforms like Twitter offer a unique opportunity to observe and analyze user behavior that may indicate mental health issues. Twitter, in particular, is an ideal site for this research due to its public nature and the brevity of its content, which allows for easier data collection and analysis.

    **1.1 Analyzing User Interaction Data**

    In the first section of our study, we focus on quantitative metrics such as the number of likes, favorites, retweets, and followers that Twitter users have. These metrics offer insights into user engagement and social connectedness, which can be correlated with mental health status. To analyze these data points, we employ several machine learning techniques. Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (e.g., likelihood of depression) and one or more independent variables (e.g., likes, retweets). It is particularly useful for understanding how each feature contributes to the outcome and for predicting continuous outcomes. Logistic regression, on the other hand, is employed for binary classification problems, such as determining whether a user is likely to be depressed or not based on their interaction data. This method is effective in cases where the outcome variable is categorical.

    Additionally, we utilize decision trees, a non-parametric supervised learning method that can model complex relationships between input features and outcomes. Decision trees are interpretable and capable of capturing non-linear interactions between features, making them suitable for identifying patterns in user behavior that may indicate depression. To further enhance the predictive accuracy, random forests are applied. Random forests aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees, improving accuracy and robustness. This technique reduces the risk of overfitting and enhances the model's ability to generalize from the data, making it a powerful tool for predicting depression based on social media activity.

    **1.2 Textual Analysis of Tweets**

    The second part of our study focuses on the textual analysis of user tweets to extract information that may indicate depressive states. We use several advanced text mining techniques to analyze the linguistic content of tweets. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is employed for sentiment analysis; it is a lexicon and rule-based tool specifically designed to analyze sentiments expressed in social media contexts. VADER is effective in assessing the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets, which can help identify depressive language.

    We also use the bag-of-words approach combined with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and relaxed LASSO for feature selection and regularization. The bag-of-words model represents text as an unordered collection of words, and LASSO enhances prediction accuracy by selecting the most relevant features while penalizing less important ones. Relaxed LASSO allows for greater flexibility, improving model performance in identifying pertinent features from text data. In addition to this, n-grams analysis is conducted to capture common phrases and word patterns associated with depression. By examining n-grams, we gain deeper insights into the language used by individuals experiencing depressive symptoms.

    Furthermore, we implement BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sequence classification. BERT is a state-of-the-art model for natural language understanding, and in this study, it is used to analyze the semantic context of tweets. By leveraging deep learning, BERT can capture complex linguistic patterns and contextual nuances that simpler models might overlook, making it highly effective for detecting subtle indicators of depression. By integrating these quantitative and textual analyses, this study aims to develop comprehensive frameworks for detecting depression based on Twitter activity, contributing valuable insights to the field of digital mental health.

    #*Detecting Depression Amongst Twitter Users*


    ```R
    if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

## Exploratory Data Analysis

###Load the Data. Data from
[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infamouscoder/mental-health-social-media).\
Download and upload as `Mental-Health-Twitter.csv` to the folder
`data`.\
\
Using package `data.table` to read and to manipulate data is much faster
than using `read.csv()` especially when the dataset is large.

###Subsetting Let's first take a small piece of it to work through. We
could use `fread` to only load `nrows` many rows to avoid loading the
entire dataset.

``` r
#data.all <- read.csv("yelp_subset.csv", as.is=TRUE) # as.is = T to keep the texts as character
data.all <- fread("/content/data/Mental_Health_Twitter.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dim(data.all)
object.size(data.all)
summary(data.all)
str(data.all)
```

#Text Analysis: Kaggle Dataset

## Bag of Words & Term Frequency

###Corpus: a collection of text\
- `VCorpus()`: create Volatile Corpus\
- `inspect()`: display detailed info of a corpus

``` r
mycorpus1 <- VCorpus(VectorSource(data.subset$post_text))
mycorpus1
typeof(mycorpus1)   ## It is a list
# inspect the first corpus
inspect(mycorpus1[[1]])
# or use `as.character` to extract the text
as.character(mycorpus1[[1]])
```

    <<VCorpus>>
    Metadata:  corpus specific: 0, document level (indexed): 0
    Content:  documents: 16288

'list'

    <<PlainTextDocument>>
    Metadata:  7
    Content:  chars: 140

    It's just over 2 years since I was diagnosed with #anxiety and #depression. Today I'm taking a moment to reflect on how far I've come since.

###Data cleaning using `tm_map()`

Before transforming the text into a word frequency matrix, we should
transform the text into a more standard format and clean the text by
removing punctuation, numbers and some common words that do not have
predictive power (a.k.a.
[stopwords](https://kavita-ganesan.com/what-are-stop-words/#:~:text=Stop%20words%20are%20a%20set,on%20the%20important%20words%20instead);
e.g. pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions). This can be tedious but is
necessary for quality analyses. We use the `tm_map()` function with
different available transformations including `removeNumbers()`,
`removePunctuation()`, `removeWords()`, `stemDocument()`, and
`stripWhitespace()`. It works like the `apply()` class function to apply
the function to corpus. Details of each step are in the appendix. These
cleaning techniques are not one-size-fits-all, and the techniques
appropriate for your data will vary based on context.

``` r
# Converts all words to lowercase
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus1, content_transformer(tolower))

# Removes common English stopwords (e.g. "with", "i")
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, removeWords, stopwords("english"))

# Removes any punctuation
# NOTE: This step may not be appropriate if you want to account for differences
#       on semantics depending on which sentence a word belongs to if you end up
#       using n-grams or k-skip-n-grams.
#       Instead, periods (or semicolons, etc.) can be replaced with a unique
#       token (e.g. "[PERIOD]") that retains this semantic meaning.
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, removePunctuation)

# Removes numbers
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, removeNumbers)

# Stem words
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, stemDocument, lazy = TRUE)
```

###Word frequency matrix

Now we transform each review into a word frequency matrix using the
function `DocumentTermMatrix()`.

``` r
dtm1 <- DocumentTermMatrix( mycorpus_clean )   ## library = collection of words for all documents
class(dtm1)
inspect(dtm1) # typeof(dtm1)  #length(dimnames(dtm1)$Terms)
```

### Reduce the size of the bag

Many words do not appear nearly as often as others. If your cleaning was
done appropriately, it will hopefully not lose much of the information
if we drop such rare words. So, we first cut the bag to only include the
words appearing at least 1% (or the frequency of your choice) of the
time. This reduces the dimension of the features extracted to be
analyzed.

``` r
threshold <- .01*length(mycorpus_clean)   # 1% of the total documents
words.10 <- findFreqTerms(dtm1, lowfreq=threshold)  # words appearing at least among 1% of the documents
length(words.10)
tail(words.10, n=10)
```

**`removeSparseTerms()`**:

Anther way to reduce the size of the bag is to use `removeSparseTerms`

``` r
dtm.10.2 <- removeSparseTerms(dtm1, 1-.01)  # control sparsity < .99
inspect(dtm.10.2)
# colnames(dtm.10.2)[1:50]

colnames(dtm.10)[!(colnames(dtm.10) %in% colnames(dtm.10.2))]

We end up with two different bags because

-   `findFreqTerms()`: counts a word multiple times if it appears
    multiple times in one document.\
-   `removeSparseTerms()`: keep words that appear at least once in X% of
    documents.

### One step to get `DTM`

We consolidate all possible processing steps to the following clean
`R-chunk`, turning texts (input) into `Document Term Frequency` which is
a sparse matrix (output) to be used in the down-stream analyses.

All the `tm_map()` can be called inside `DocumentTermMatrix` under
parameter called `control`. Here is how.

``` r

## N-grams

Using the `tm` package along with a custom tokenizer, we can now
implement n-grams using R! As is, the tokenizer is set to produce
bugrams but you should be able to change this by tweaking the variable
`n`.

``` r
# The 'n' for n-grams
# n=2 is bi-grams
n <- 2

# Our custom tokenizer
# Uses the ngrams function from the NLP package
# Right now this is for bigrams, but you can change it by changing the value of
# the variable n (includes N-grams for any N <= n)
ngram_tokenizer <- function(x, n) {
  unlist(lapply(ngrams(words(x), 1:n), paste, collapse = "_"), use.names = FALSE)
}
```

We next prepare a clean corpus

``` r
# Converts all words to lowercase
mycorpus1  <- VCorpus(VectorSource(data.subset$post_text))
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus1, content_transformer(tolower))

# Removes common English stopwords (e.g. "with", "i")
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, removeWords, stopwords("english"))

# Removes any punctuation
# NOTE: This step may not be appropriate if you want to account for differences
#       on semantics depending on which sentence a word belongs to if you end up
#       using n-grams or k-skip-n-grams.
#       Instead, periods (or semicolons, etc.) can be replaced with a unique
#       token (e.g. "[PERIOD]") that retains this semantic meaning.
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, removePunctuation)

# Removes numbers
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, removeNumbers)

# Stem words
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, stemDocument, lazy = TRUE)
```

Apply the bigram tokenizer to the first review, we see the library or
word of bag is enlarged.

``` r
inspect(mycorpus_clean[[1]])  # see review 1 again
ngram_tokenizer(mycorpus_clean[[1]], 2) # output bigram of review 1
```

While we won't run any analyses with the n-grams, we encourage you to
play around with some of the settings to see how the DTM changes, as
well as how the analysis might be improved (or worsened) by including
the higher order n-grams.

``` r
# use ngram_tokenizer()
control_list_ngram <- list(tokenize = function(x) ngram_tokenizer(x, 2))

dtm_ngram <- DocumentTermMatrix(mycorpus_clean, control_list_ngram)
# kick out rare words
dtm_ngram.10 <- removeSparseTerms(dtm_ngram, 1-.01)
inspect(dtm_ngram.10)

##Analysis

Once we have turned a text into a vector, we can then apply any methods
suitable for the settings. In our case we will use logistic regression
models and LASSO to explore the relationship between `label` and `text`.

### Data preparation

The following chunk output a data frame called data2, combining
everything and all the tf's of each word.

``` r
names(data.subset)
# Combine the original data with the text matrix
data1.temp <- data.frame(data.subset,as.matrix(dtm_ngram.10) )
dim(data1.temp)
names(data1.temp)[1:30]
#str(data1.temp)
# data2 consists of date, label and all the top 1% words
data2 <- data1.temp[, c(7:ncol(data1.temp))]
#data2 <- data1.temp
names(data2)[1:20]
dim(data2)  ### remember we have only run 1000 rows

#### We have previously run the entire 100,000 rows and output the DTM out.
### if not, run and write as csv
fwrite(data2, "/content/data/Twitter_tm_freq.csv", row.names = FALSE)

### Splitting data

``` r
data2 <- fread("/content/data/Twitter_tm_freq.csv")  #dim(data2)
names(data2)[1:20] # notice that user_id, stars and date are in the data2
dim(data2)
data2 <- data2 %>% mutate(label=as.factor(label))# %>% select(-"label_numeric")
table(data2$label)

As one standard machine learning process, we first split data into two
sets one training data and the other testing data. We use training data
to build models, choose models etc and make final recommendations. We
then report the performance using the testing data.

Reserve 100 randomly chosen rows as our test data (`data2.test`) and the
remaining 900 as the training data (`data2.train`)

``` r
set.seed(1)  # for the purpose of reporducibility
n <- nrow(data2)
test.index <- sample(n, 0.1*n)
# length(test.index)
data2.test <- data2[test.index, -1] # only keep label and the texts
data2.train <- data2[-test.index, -1]
dim(data2.train)
```

### Analysis 1: LASSO

We first explore a logistic regression model using LASSO. The following
R-chunk runs a LASSO model with $\alpha=.99$. The reason we take an
elastic net is to enjoy the nice properties from both `LASSO` (impose
sparsity) and `Ridge` (computationally stable).

LASSO takes sparse design matrix as an input. So make sure to extract
the sparse matrix first as the input in cv.glm(). It takes about 1
minute to run cv.glm() with sparse matrix or 11 minutes using the
regular design matrix.

``` r
### or try `sparse.model.matrix()` which is much faster
y <- data2.train$label
X1 <- sparse.model.matrix(label~., data=data2.train)[, -1]
set.seed(2)
result.lasso <- cv.glmnet(X1, y, alpha=.99, family=binomial(logit))
# 1.25 minutes in my MAC
plot(result.lasso)
# this this may take you long time to run, we save result.lasso
saveRDS(result.lasso, file="data/TextMining_lasso.RDS")
# result.lasso can be assigned back by
# result.lasso <- readRDS("data/TextMining_lasso.RDS")

# number of non-zero words picked up by LASSO when using lambda.1se
# coef.1se <- coef(result.lasso, s="lambda.1se")
# lasso.words <- coef.1se@Dimnames[[1]] [coef.1se@i][-1] # non-zero variables without intercept.
# summary(lasso.words)


# or our old way
coef.1se <- coef(result.lasso, s="lambda.1se")
coef.1se <- coef.1se[which(coef.1se !=0),]
lasso.words <- rownames(as.matrix(coef.1se))[-1]
summary(lasso.words)



### cv.glmnt with the non-sparse design matrix takes much longer
# X <- as.matrix(data2.train[, -1]) # we can use as.matrix directly her
#### Be careful to run the following LASSO.
#set.seed(2)
#result.lasso <- cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha=.99, family="binomial")
# 10 minutes in my MAC
#plot(result.lasso)
```

### Analysis 2: Relaxed LASSO

As an alternative model we will run our relaxed `LASSO`. Input variables
are chosen by `LASSO` and we get a regular logistic regression model.
Once again it is stored as `result.glm` in `TextMining.RData`.

``` r
sel_cols <- c("label", lasso.words)
# use all_of() to specify we would like to select variables in sel_cols
data_sub <- data2.train %>% select(all_of(sel_cols))
result.glm <- glm(label~., family=binomial, data_sub) # takes 3.5 minutes
## glm() returns a big object with unnecessary information
# saveRDS(result.glm,
#      file = "data/TextMining_glm.RDS")

## trim the glm() fat from
## https://win-vector.com/2014/05/30/trimming-the-fat-from-glm-models-in-r/

}

#result.glm.small <- stripGlmLR(result.glm)
result.glm.small <- result.glm

saveRDS(result.glm.small,
     file = "/content/data/TextMining_glm_small.RDS")
```

### Analysis 3: Word cloud! (Sentiment analysis)

Logistic regression model connects the chance of `being good` given a
text/review. What are the `nice` (or positive) words and how much it
influence the chance being good? In addition to explore the set of good
words we also build word clouds to visualize the correlation between
positive words and negative words.

1.  Order the glm positive coefficients (positive words). Show them in a
    word cloud. The size of the words indicates the strength of positive
    correlation between that word and the chance being a good rating.

2.  Order the glm negative coefficients (negative words)

TIME TO PLOT A WORD CLOUD!! Plot the world clouds, the size of the words
are prop to the logistic reg coef's

``` r
result.glm <- readRDS("data/TextMining_glm_small.RDS")
result.glm.coef <- coef(result.glm)[-1]  # took intercept out
print(coef(result.glm))

The above chunk shows in detail about the weight for positive words. We
only show the positive word-cloud here. One can tell the large positive
words are making sense in the way we do expect the collection of large
words should have a positive tone towards the restaurant being reviewed.

``` r
cor.special <- brewer.pal(8,"Dark2")  # set up a pretty color scheme
wordcloud(good.word, good.fre,  # make a word cloud
          colors=cor.special,
          ordered.colors=F, min.freq=0)
```

###Negative Wordcloud

Similarly to the negative coef's which is positively correlated to the
probability of having depression.

``` r
bad.glm <- result.glm.coef[which(result.glm.coef < 0)]
# names(bad.glm)[1:50]

cor.special <- brewer.pal(6,"Dark2")
bad.fre <- sort(-bad.glm, decreasing = TRUE)
round(bad.fre, 4)

# hist(as.matrix(bad.fre), breaks=30, col="green")
bad.word <- names(bad.fre)
wordcloud(bad.word, bad.fre,
          color=cor.special, ordered.colors=F, min.freq=0)
```

###Data cleaning using `tm_map()`

Before transforming the text into a word frequency matrix, we should
transform the text into a more standard format and clean the text by
removing punctuation, numbers and some common words that do not have
predictive power (a.k.a.
[stopwords](https://kavita-ganesan.com/what-are-stop-words/#:~:text=Stop%20words%20are%20a%20set,on%20the%20important%20words%20instead);
e.g. pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions). This can be tedious but is
necessary for quality analyses. We use the `tm_map()` function with
different available transformations including `removeNumbers()`,
`removePunctuation()`, `removeWords()`, `stemDocument()`, and
`stripWhitespace()`. It works like the `apply()` class function to apply
the function to corpus. Details of each step are in the appendix. These
cleaning techniques are not one-size-fits-all, and the techniques
appropriate for your data will vary based on context.

``` r
# Converts all words to lowercase
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus1, content_transformer(tolower))

# Removes common English stopwords (e.g. "with", "i")
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, removeWords, stopwords("english"))

# Removes any punctuation
# NOTE: This step may not be appropriate if you want to account for differences
#       on semantics depending on which sentence a word belongs to if you end up
#       using n-grams or k-skip-n-grams.
#       Instead, periods (or semicolons, etc.) can be replaced with a unique
#       token (e.g. "[PERIOD]") that retains this semantic meaning.
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, removePunctuation)

# Removes numbers
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, removeNumbers)

# Stem words
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, stemDocument, lazy = TRUE)
```

###Word frequency matrix

Now we transform each review into a word frequency matrix using the
function `DocumentTermMatrix()`.

``` r
dtm1 <- DocumentTermMatrix( mycorpus_clean )   ## library = collection of words for all documents
class(dtm1)
inspect(dtm1) # typeof(dtm1)  #length(dimnames(dtm1)$Terms)
```

### Reduce the size of the bag

Many words do not appear nearly as often as others. If your cleaning was
done appropriately, it will hopefully not lose much of the information
if we drop such rare words. So, we first cut the bag to only include the
words appearing at least 1% (or the frequency of your choice) of the
time. This reduces the dimension of the features extracted to be
analyzed.

``` r
threshold <- .01*length(mycorpus_clean)   # 1% of the total documents
words.10 <- findFreqTerms(dtm1, lowfreq=threshold)  # words appearing at least among 1% of the documents
length(words.10)
tail(words.10, n=10)
```

**`removeSparseTerms()`**:

Anther way to reduce the size of the bag is to use `removeSparseTerms`

``` r
dtm.10.2 <- removeSparseTerms(dtm1, 1-.01)  # control sparsity < .99
inspect(dtm.10.2)
# colnames(dtm.10.2)[1:50]
# words that are in dtm.10 but not in dtm.10.2
colnames(dtm.10)[!(colnames(dtm.10) %in% colnames(dtm.10.2))]
```

We end up with two different bags because

-   `findFreqTerms()`: counts a word multiple times if it appears
    multiple times in one document.\
-   `removeSparseTerms()`: keep words that appear at least once in X% of
    documents.

### One step to get `DTM`

We consolidate all possible processing steps to the following clean
`R-chunk`, turning texts (input) into `Document Term Frequency` which is
a sparse matrix (output) to be used in the down-stream analyses.

All the `tm_map()` can be called inside `DocumentTermMatrix` under
parameter called `control`. Here is how.

``` r
# Turn texts to corpus
mycorpus1  <- VCorpus(VectorSource(data.subset$post_text))


# Control list for creating our DTM within DocumentTermMatrix
# Can tweak settings based off if you want punctuation, numbers, etc.
control_list <- list( tolower = TRUE,
                      removePunctuation = TRUE,
                      removeNumbers = TRUE,
                      stopwords = stopwords("english"),
                      stemming = TRUE)
# dtm with all terms:
dtm.10.long  <- DocumentTermMatrix(mycorpus1, control = control_list)
#inspect(dtm.10.long)

# kick out rare words
dtm.10<- removeSparseTerms(dtm.10.long, 1-.01)
inspect(dtm.10)

# look at the document 1 before and after cleaning
# inspect(mycorpus1[[1]])
# after cleaning
# colnames(as.matrix(dtm1[1, ]))[which(as.matrix(dtm1[1, ]) != 0)]
```

    <<DocumentTermMatrix (documents: 20000, terms: 92)>>

## N-grams

Using the `tm` package along with a custom tokenizer, we can now
implement n-grams using R! As is, the tokenizer is set to produce
bugrams but you should be able to change this by tweaking the variable
`n`.

``` r
# The 'n' for n-grams
# n=2 is bi-grams
n <- 2

# Our custom tokenizer
# Uses the ngrams function from the NLP package
# Right now this is for bigrams, but you can change it by changing the value of
# the variable n (includes N-grams for any N <= n)
ngram_tokenizer <- function(x, n) {
  unlist(lapply(ngrams(words(x), 1:n), paste, collapse = "_"), use.names = FALSE)
}
```

We next prepare a clean copus

``` r
# Converts all words to lowercase
mycorpus1  <- VCorpus(VectorSource(data.subset$post_text))
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus1, content_transformer(tolower))

# Removes common English stopwords (e.g. "with", "i")
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, removeWords, stopwords("english"))

# Removes any punctuation
# NOTE: This step may not be appropriate if you want to account for differences
#       on semantics depending on which sentence a word belongs to if you end up
#       using n-grams or k-skip-n-grams.
#       Instead, periods (or semicolons, etc.) can be replaced with a unique
#       token (e.g. "[PERIOD]") that retains this semantic meaning.
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, removePunctuation)

# Removes numbers
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, removeNumbers)

# Stem words
mycorpus_clean <- tm_map(mycorpus_clean, stemDocument, lazy = TRUE)
```

Apply the bigram tokenizer to the first review, we see the library or
word of bag is enlarged.

``` r
inspect(mycorpus_clean[[1]])  # see review 1 again
ngram_tokenizer(mycorpus_clean[[1]], 2) # output bigram of review 1
```

While we won't run any analyses with the n-grams, we encourage you to
play around with some of the settings to see how the DTM changes, as
well as how the analysis might be improved (or worsened) by including
the higher order n-grams.

``` r
# use ngram_tokenizer()
control_list_ngram <- list(tokenize = function(x) ngram_tokenizer(x, 2))

dtm_ngram <- DocumentTermMatrix(mycorpus_clean, control_list_ngram)
# kick out rare words
dtm_ngram.10 <- removeSparseTerms(dtm_ngram, 1-.01)
inspect(dtm_ngram.10)

##Analysis

Once we have turned a text into a vector, we can then apply any methods
suitable for the settings. In our case we will use logistic regression
models and LASSO to explore the relationship between `label` and `text`.

### Data preparation

The following chunk output a data frame called data2, combining
everything and all the tf's of each word.

``` r
names(data.subset)
# Combine the original data with the text matrix
data1.temp <- data.frame(data.subset,as.matrix(dtm_ngram.10) )
dim(data1.temp)
names(data1.temp)[1:30]
#str(data1.temp)
# data2 consists of date, label and all the top 1% words
data2 <- data1.temp[, -1]
#data2 <- data1.temp
names(data2)[1:20]
dim(data2)  ### remember we have only run 1000 rows

#### We have previously run the entire 100,000 rows and output the DTM out.
### if not, run and write as csv
fwrite(data2, "/content/data/Twitter_tm_freq.csv", row.names = FALSE)

data2 <- fread("/content/data/Twitter_tm_freq.csv")  #dim(data2)
names(data2)[1:20] # notice that user_id, stars and date are in the data2
dim(data2)
data2$label <- as.factor(data2$label)
table(data2$label)

As one standard machine learning process, we first split data into two
sets one training data and the other testing data. We use training data
to build models, choose models etc and make final recommendations. We
then report the performance using the testing data.

Reserve 100 randomly chosen rows as our test data (`data2.test`) and the
remaining 900 as the training data (`data2.train`)

``` r
set.seed(1)  # for the purpose of reporducibility
n <- nrow(data2)
test.index <- sample(n, 0.1*n)
# length(test.index)
data2.test <- data2[test.index, ] # only keep label and the texts
data2.train <- data2[-test.index, ]
dim(data2.train)

### Analysis 1: LASSO

We first explore a logistic regression model using LASSO. The following
R-chunk runs a LASSO model with $\alpha=.99$. The reason we take an
elastic net is to enjoy the nice properties from both `LASSO` (impose
sparsity) and `Ridge` (computationally stable).

LASSO takes sparse design matrix as an input. So make sure to extract
the sparse matrix first as the input in cv.glm(). It takes about 1
minute to run cv.glm() with sparse matrix or 11 minutes using the
regular design matrix.

``` r
### or try `sparse.model.matrix()` which is much faster
y <- data2.train$label
X1 <- sparse.model.matrix(label~., data=data2.train)[, -1]
set.seed(2)
result.lasso <- cv.glmnet(X1, y, alpha=.99, family="binomial")
# 1.25 minutes in my MAC
plot(result.lasso)
# this this may take you long time to run, we save result.lasso
saveRDS(result.lasso, file="data/TextMining_lasso.RDS")
# result.lasso can be assigned back by
# result.lasso <- readRDS("data/TextMining_lasso.RDS")

# number of non-zero words picked up by LASSO when using lambda.1se
coef.1se <- coef(result.lasso, s="lambda.1se")
lasso.words <- coef.1se@Dimnames[[1]] [coef.1se@i][-1] # non-zero variables without intercept.
summary(lasso.words)


# or our old way
#coef.1se <- coef(result.lasso, s="lambda.1se")
#coef.1se <- coef.1se[which(coef.1se !=0),]
#lasso.words <- rownames(as.matrix(coef.1se))[-1]
#summary(lasso.words)



### cv.glmnt with the non-sparse design matrix takes much longer
# X <- as.matrix(data2.train[, -1]) # we can use as.matrix directly her
#### Be careful to run the following LASSO.
#set.seed(2)
#result.lasso <- cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha=.99, family="binomial")
# 10 minutes in my MAC
#plot(result.lasso)
```

### Analysis 2: Relaxed LASSO

As an alternative model we will run our relaxed `LASSO`. Input variables
are chosen by `LASSO` and we get a regular logistic regression model.
Once again it is stored as `result.glm` in `TextMining.RData`.

``` r
sel_cols <- c("label", lasso.words)
# use all_of() to specify we would like to select variables in sel_cols
data_sub <- data2.train %>% select(all_of(sel_cols))
result.glm <- glm(label~., family=binomial, data_sub) # takes 3.5 minutes
## glm() returns a big object with unnecessary information
# saveRDS(result.glm,
#      file = "data/TextMining_glm.RDS")

## trim the glm() fat from

### Analysis 3: Word cloud! (Sentiment analysis)

Logistic regression model connects the chance of `being good` given a
text/review. What are the `nice` (or positive) words and how much it
influence the chance being good? In addition to explore the set of good
words we also build word clouds to visualize the correlation between
positive words and negative words.

1.  Order the glm positive coefficients (positive words). Show them in a
    word cloud. The size of the words indicates the strength of positive
    correlation between that word and the chance being a good rating.

2.  Order the glm negative coefficients (negative words)

TIME TO PLOT A WORD CLOUD!! Plot the world clouds, the size of the words
are prop to the logistic reg coef's

``` r
result.glm <- readRDS("data/TextMining_glm_small.RDS")
result.glm.coef <- coef(result.glm)[-1]  # took intercept out
hist(result.glm.coef)

# pick up the positive coef's which are positively related to the prob of being depressed
good.glm <- result.glm.coef[which(result.glm.coef > 0)]
good.glm <- good.glm
names(good.glm)  # which words are positively associated with depression

good.fre <- sort(good.glm, decreasing = TRUE) # sort the coef's
round(good.fre, 4) # leading 20 positive words, amazing!
length(good.fre)  # 390 good words

# hist(as.matrix(good.fre), breaks=30, col="red")
good.word <- names(good.fre)  # good words with a decreasing order in the coeff's

The above chunk shows in detail about the weight for positive words. We
only show the positive word-cloud here. One can tell the large positive
words are making sense in the way we do expect the collection of large
words should have a positive tone towards the restaurant being reviewed.

``` r
cor.special <- brewer.pal(8,"Dark2")  # set up a pretty color scheme
wordcloud(good.word, good.fre,  # make a word cloud
          colors=cor.special,
          ordered.colors=F, min.freq=0)
```

###Negative Wordcloud

Similarly to the negative coef's which is positively correlated to the
probability of having depression.

``` r
bad.glm <- result.glm.coef[which(result.glm.coef < 0)]
# names(bad.glm)[1:50]

cor.special <- brewer.pal(6,"Dark2")
bad.fre <- sort(-bad.glm, decreasing = TRUE)
round(bad.fre, 4)

# hist(as.matrix(bad.fre), breaks=30, col="green")
bad.word <- names(bad.fre)
wordcloud(bad.word, bad.fre,
          color=cor.special, ordered.colors=F, min.freq=0)

###Testing

LASSO Prediction

``` r
predict.lasso <- ifelse(predict(result.lasso, as.matrix(data2.test[, -1]), type = "response", s="lambda.1se")>.5, "1", "0")
  # output lasso estimates of prob's
#predict.lasso <- predict(result.lasso, as.matrix(data2.test[, -1]), type = "class", s="lambda.1se")
  # output majority vote labels

# LASSO accuracy
mean(data2.test$label == predict.lasso)   #0.5425; 0.5405 with n-grams
```

0.5405

Relaxed LASSO Prediction

``` r
predict.glm <- predict(result.glm, data2.test, type = "response")
class.glm <- ifelse(predict.glm > .5, "1", "0")
# length(class.glm)

testerror.glm <- mean(data2.test$label == class.glm)
testerror.glm   #classification accuracy is 0.5305; 0.534 with n-grams
```

0.534
