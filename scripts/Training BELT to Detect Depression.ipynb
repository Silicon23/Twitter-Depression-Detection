Tell me why I just bought a pack of 50 stickers, miso paste, and a stuffed animal on amazon. If you were wondering, no I am not okay.. @robbieheart_ Lol no not yet and I have a picture of it on my phone and I was trying to remember why 😂😂😭 now I remember.

Everything just feels extra hard right now.. @Emmmmmilyyyyyy Exactly!! It’s the effort that makes all the difference. So this is probably my mind playing tricks on me but I really thought I had a ghost in my apartment when I first moved here. Then I met my ex and the ghost left. But I think he’s back!. Tag yourself. I’m Pauly disassociating on the side. https://t.co/012AHolUdX. My mom spent a stupid amount of money on fancy dinner being delivered because I’m such a downer these days and it almost cured my depression....almost. I’m only working 2 and a half hours today but I still am not happy about having to go to work today. Men 🤮 https://t.co/waW9uzKjul.
