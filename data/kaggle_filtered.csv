3988,I ask her what her fav outfit was and she says she doesn't know the name of the girl but she can draw it,43,59,4301,12309,1
3989,"then I ask how she knew about cosplay and she says ""I really like anime girl outfits and I used to cosplay myself""",43,59,4301,12309,1

4000,its late night and she starts asking me about a bunch of trans stuff and I just answer her honestly,43,59,4301,12309,1
4001,the reason I was supposed to go see my mom was she wanted to talk to me about something face to face,43,59,4301,12309,1
